<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I’m a second-year Master student from the School of Computer Science, Nankai University. I received my Master's degree at Xidian University in 2021. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [**Jufeng Yang**](https://cv.nankai.edu.cn/) of Computer Vision Lab.

My research interests include computer vision and deep learning, especially focusing on image-text multi-modal learning, semantic segmentation, and label distribution learning. Please feel free to contact me through email: downdric@163.com.
